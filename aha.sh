Dear [Partner's Name],

We have reviewed the case and noted that the Access Point cannot obtain an IP address on any of the btVLAN SSIDs. Our analysis shows that the VLAN tagging on the DSW250-8P-2X switch appears correct, indicating that the issue is likely upstream.

We recommend connecting the DSW250-8P-2X switch directly to the router to isolate and identify the upstream issue.

Please proceed with this adjustment and let us know if the issue persists.

Best regards,
