Hello Edman,
 
Our L3 Took a look at this case this morning, 
They Believe this is an Upstream issue of the Switch. The Access Point itself is not able to get an IP address on any of the 4 listed VLANs the Access Point repeatedly sending DHCP discovers and getting no offer.
 
They recommended Bypassing the Cisco Switch as well.
